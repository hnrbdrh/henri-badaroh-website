As Stockholm's oldest quay, Skeppsbron and Skeppsbrokajen have a unique history as the 'shop window' of Sweden: a hub for the import and export of goods, a marketplace, a thoroughfare, and a metaphorical bridge between the capital and the rest of Europe. Between people, ideas and commerce, this was once Stockholm's foremost site of exchange. Although it still stands as a defining image of the city today, it has come to be dominated by car parks and underused public space.
