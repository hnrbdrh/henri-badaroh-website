Loosely inspired by Glauber Rocha’s seminal work, the film Entranced Earth (Terra em Transe, 1967), Entranced Brazilians utilises elements of internet language in an analysis of the creative thinking and expression of various Brazilian personalities during the second half of the 20th century, an important period in the country’s development, historically as well as artistically.
