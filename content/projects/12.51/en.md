12:51 presents a series of photographs made every day for an entire (leap) year at nine to thirteen. This exercise resulted in 352 snapshots orderly arranged in a panel, posing the question: what has happened to/in the fortnight of the unproduced images?

The inexistent images created a second, mirrored panel with nothing but nothing on it. A tactile sheet of paper in braille (1991 UEB code, grade 2), for the invisible can still be felt and experienced.
