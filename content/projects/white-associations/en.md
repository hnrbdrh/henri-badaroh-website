In 2015, I moved from Brazil to the Netherlands. For the first time in my life I was racialised. There was an incredibly strong need for people to define who and how I looked like – as to make their interaction with me and my racial "ambiguity" more comfortable to them.

*White Associations*, inspired by visual artist Nancy Burson's morphing composites, investigates white people's understanding of race and miscegenation, through the six celebrities (and one racist character) I was compared to.
