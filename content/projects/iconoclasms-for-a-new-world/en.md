Loosely inspired by Glauber Rocha’s seminal work, the film Entranced Earth (Terra em Transe, 1967), Entranced Brazilians utilises elements of internet language in an analysis of the creative thinking and expression of various Brazilian personalities during the second half of the 20th century, an important period in the country’s development, historically as well as artistically.

As Stockholm's oldest quay, Skeppsbron and Skeppsbrokajen have a unique history as the 'shop window' of Sweden: a hub for the import and export of goods, a marketplace, a thoroughfare, and a metaphorical bridge between the capital and the rest of Europe. Between people, ideas and commerce, this was once Stockholm's foremost site of exchange. Although it still stands as a defining image of the city today, it has come to be dominated by car parks and underused public space.
