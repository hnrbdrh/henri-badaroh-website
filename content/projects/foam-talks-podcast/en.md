<em>with</em> Alice Quaresma <em>for the</em> 15th Anniversary <em>of </em> Foam Magazine's Talent Issue

In 2022, Foam celebrated a special anniversary: Foam Magazine's Talent Issue turned 15. To put a spotlight on Foam Talents, as well as the people behind Foam Magazine, Foam Talks invited its editors to host of a mini-series.
The final episode welcomed Henri Badaröh, assistant editor, and Alice Quaresma who was selected as a Foam Talent in 2014 with her series <em>Roots</em>, for a chat on her practice and the impact of being a Talent. 
Formally trained as a painter, Alice has been experimenting with materials and media that allow her photographs to be sensorial and playful, pushing the boundaries of photography as a descriptive medium. Using snapshots from her archive and painted geometric designs, she reflects on identity and memory, stimulating the ludic quality in her images.
