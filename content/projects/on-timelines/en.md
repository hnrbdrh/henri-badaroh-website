The relatively recent internet-related phenomenon of timelines raised one of the effects which could be considered as part of the social media evil: the ephemeral behaviour.

Timelines in social media as <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Instagram</em>, <em>Twitter</em> and <em>Tumblr</em> provide as much news, updates, statuses as possible within a few scrolls, however, this <em>apparently</em> inoffensive social service seems to give far more information one could ever take.

That being said, people receive a lot of unwanted data and then, with their brains filled excessively with today’s never-ending details, they move from one post to another, eventually <em>deleting</em> what had just been seen in order to <em>declutter</em> and free up space in their minds. Similar to the process of a memory card — yes, welcome to the 21st century.

To put it in a nutshell, timelines showcase the worst in us: memories (as well as news, people, art) become shallow; grieving is sharp and concise — not more important than any morning meal; and feelings are neglected, irrelevant, unconsidered. After all, one must keep on living, keep on going further and farther, even if not really knowing where they are heading themselves to.
