Conceived by Marília Librandi, Clarice 100 Ears is a multilingual and open-ended sound library launched in November 2020 to celebrate Clarice Lispector’s centennial. The initiative gathers writers, artists, scholars, and everyday readers from Brazil and around the world giving voice to Clarice’s writings.
In ep. 16, Henri Badaröh reads the crônica “Ao Correr da Máquina” (“Racing Against the Typewriter”) from <em>A Descoberta do Mundo</em> [Discovering the World], in Brazilian Portuguese and in English.
