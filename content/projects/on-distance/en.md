When it concerns art, specifically an artwork recently <em>completed</em>, it is most important to keep some distance and allow oneself to “forget” one’s own work and then return with not only fresh eyes, but also critical and contemplative ones — as those of a person who never had artistic ambitions or pretensions. This way, both maker and work can grow to a fuller potential.
